# IoT-Based-Fire-Fighting-Robot

## 📘 Overview
This project was developed as a **mini project** in the **second part of the course Engineering Clinics (ECS)**.  
The **IoT-Based Fire-Fighting Robot** is an intelligent system designed to **detect and extinguish fires automatically** in hazardous environments.  
It uses **Arduino Uno**, **flame and temperature sensors**, and **IoT technology** to identify fire sources, activate a water pump, and send real-time updates to the user through an IoT platform.  
The main goal is to **reduce human risk** and enable **faster fire response** in industrial and domestic areas.
