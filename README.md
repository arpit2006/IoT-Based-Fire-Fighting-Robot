# IoT-Based-Fire-Fighting-Robot
This project, developed as a mini project in the second part of Engineering Clinics (ECS), presents an IoT-based fire-fighting robot using Arduino Uno. It detects and extinguishes fires automatically with flame and temperature sensors, aiming to reduce human risk and improve fire response time.
